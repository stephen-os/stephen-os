## About Me

I'm passionate about low-level systems programming, backend engineering, and security. I love building software that solves real problems—whether that's creating developer tools, optimizing systems, or exploring the intersection of rendering, physics, and mathematics. I'm driven by curiosity and the challenge of understanding how things work at a fundamental level.
